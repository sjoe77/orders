# This is a sample project to show the effectiveness of thhis rails template.

## Project Use Case
An order & inventory management system for a small business. Orders have 1 or many line items. Ccustomer will place 1 or more orders. Inventory keep strack of products counts. Customer can have multiple addresses. Address type can be shipping or billing addresses. US and international addresses are supported.
The project will have a dashboard to show key metrics. The project will have a product catalog with categories and tags. The project will have user authentication and authorization. The project will have a responsive design for mobile and desktop users. The rails application will be multi-tenant using database schema based tenancy. Reps are employees who manage customers and orders. Admins are employees who manage reps and have access to all customers and orders. Customers can view their own orders and place new orders. A Rep can be assigned to multiple customers. A customer can have multiple orders. An order can have multiple line items. A product can belong to multiple categories and have multiple tags. The project will use PostgreSQL as the database.

This is a sample project to prove that one can do a modular monolith with API's and UI for an Orders and Invenrory Tracking application using Ruby on rails. Not a real one. Roles are Rep, Admin, Customer. I will be using Auth0 for Ouath.
